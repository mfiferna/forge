# Product Context: Forge Game Mechanics Analysis

## Problem Being Solved

The current task aims to address the lack of documented understanding regarding how specific, fundamental Magic: The Gathering rules and mechanics are implemented within the Forge engine. This knowledge gap hinders the ability to confidently extend the engine with new features, specifically a new custom game format.

## Desired Outcome

*   A clear, documented understanding of how Forge handles game formats, mulligans, starting life/hand size, game start sequences, and deck size rules.
*   This documentation should serve as a reliable reference for future development, enabling the addition of the custom format.

## User Experience Goals (for the analysis phase)

*   The analysis should be thorough and accurate.
*   The documentation produced should be easy to understand, well-organized, and contain clear references to the relevant code sections.
