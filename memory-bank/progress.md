# Progress: Forge Game Mechanics Analysis (Documentation Complete)

## What Works / Completed

*   **Initial Code Analysis:** Successfully identified and analyzed key Java classes and files responsible for handling:
    *   Game Types and Formats
    *   Mulligan Logic (Core & UI Bridge)
    *   Starting Life and Hand Size Rules
    *   Game Start Sequence
    *   Deck Size Rules
*   **Memory Bank Setup:** Created the core Memory Bank files (`projectBrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) and the `analysis_plan.md`.
*   **Detailed Documentation:** Created the specific Markdown files detailing the findings for each mechanic:
    *   `memory-bank/game_formats.md`
    *   `memory-bank/mulligan.md`
    *   `memory-bank/starting_rules.md`
    *   `memory-bank/game_start.md`
    *   `memory-bank/deck_rules.md`

## What's Left to Build / Document

*   **Review:** User review of the documented findings.
*   **Future Implementation:** Implement the new custom game format based on the documented understanding.

## Current Status

*   Analysis phase complete.
*   Documentation phase complete.
*   Ready for user review of the documentation.

## Known Issues/Blockers

*   None at this stage.
