# Active Context: Forge Game Mechanics Analysis (Documentation Complete)

## Current Focus

*   Presenting the documented findings from the analysis of Forge's game mechanics implementation for user review.

## Recent Changes/Activities

*   Analyzed code related to Game Types, Mulligans, Starting Life/Hand Size, Game Start, and Deck Size.
*   Identified key classes and files: `GameType.java`, `DeckFormat.java`, `GameRules.java`, `MulliganService.java`, `PlayerControllerHuman.java`, `RegisteredPlayer.java`, `GameAction.java`.
*   Created the `analysis_plan.md` file.
*   Created initial versions of `projectBrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`.
*   Created detailed documentation files:
    *   `memory-bank/game_formats.md`
    *   `memory-bank/mulligan.md`
    *   `memory-bank/starting_rules.md`
    *   `memory-bank/game_start.md`
    *   `memory-bank/deck_rules.md`
*   Created initial `progress.md`.

## Next Steps

1.  Update `progress.md`.
2.  Present documented findings to the user for review using `attempt_completion`.
3.  Based on feedback, potentially refine documentation or proceed to planning the implementation of the new game format.

## Active Decisions/Considerations

*   Documentation focused on core logic and desktop UI interactions as requested.
*   Documentation structured around the specific mechanics requested by the user.
